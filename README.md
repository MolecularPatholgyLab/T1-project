Early detection of CRC is critical, as >95% of people diagnosed at stage I will survive. However, there is still 5% risk of relapse, that questioning the “linear progression” model of metastasis and show that metastatic seeding can occur from disseminated cells at the earliest stages of CRC development; suggesting a “born-to-be-bad” biology. This current study was designed to give an insight into aggressive “born-to-be-bad” biology through generation and transcriptional profiling of a novel case-controlled retrospective T1 CRC discovery cohort.
